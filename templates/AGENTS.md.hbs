# Agent Guidance & Project Standards

This document serves as a reference for AI Coding Assistants (Cursor, Claude, etc.) to ensure consistency and
high-quality engineering standards.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (Strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first)
- **Components**: shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Consistency

## 🤖 AI Coding Rules

### 1. General Principles
- **Conciseness**: Write clean, modular code. Avoid bloated components.
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any`. Use Zod for runtime validation and TypeScript for compile-time safety.
- **Modern Syntax**: Prefer functional components, hooks, and async/await.

### 2. Component Standards
- Small, focused components in `components/`.
- UI primitives in `components/ui/`.
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional classes.
- Favor Server Components by default; use `'use client'` sparingly and only at the leaf nodes.

### 3. State & Data
- **Server State**: Use TanStack React Query or Server Actions.
- **Client State**: Use Zustand for global state only if necessary.
- **Forms**: Use React Hook Form with Zod resolvers.

### 4. Performance & SEO
- Use Next.js `
<Image />` for optimized assets.
- Ensure proper semantic HTML and ARIA labels.
- Implement metadata for every page.

## 📝 Best Practices
- Follow the "Rule of Three": If you repeat logic three times, abstract it.
- Keep business logic separate from UI logic where possible.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Always include error handling for data fetching and mutations.
